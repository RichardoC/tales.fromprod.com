# Failing to record audio with a Tildagon ESP32

The [Tildagon](https://tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org/) ESP32 badge contains an [inertial measurement unit](https://tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org/tildagon-apps/reference/badge-hardware/#imu) which can measure acceleration. Since sound waves will move everything (at least a little bit) can we use this accelerometer to record audio?

No, but we can learn its limits

  <summary>Caveats</summary>
  
  * All this code was written by ChatGPT (specifically o1-preview-2024-09-12) with manual supervision.

- This code is not optimised for speed or correctness, so it could be possible to record audio, just unlikely.

</details>

## Recording the data

These scripts can be run on a connected tildagon by using [mpremote](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html)

You would then run these using `mpremote run WHATEVER-SCRIPT-SAVED-AS.py`

# Start recording
record_accelerometer(DURATION, FILE_NAME)

```

</details>

The data will be saved as `accelerometer_audio.txt` on the root of the device.

## Recovering the data

The following command will copy the recorded data off the device to your current working directory

```console
mpremote cp :accelerometer_audio.txt .
```

## Analysing the data

If you use the script below, it'll convert the raw acceleration data in to velocity and attempt to use that as an audio signal. It'll write this out as `output_audio.wav` which you can then listen to, and admire the thumps.

`pip3 install numpy scipy matplotlib`

Then run the script from the directory where you downloaded the `accelerometer_audio.txt` file.

## What does the analysed data mean

If you firmly tapped on the device during recording, you should be able to hear those taps, in a weird low quality audio recording way.

### Normalized Velocity Signal

You should be able to see any movement/firm bumps you gave to the device during recording here. The size of the bump should correspond to how "loud" the sound is at that part of the recording.

### Frequency Spectrum of the Velocity Signal

This is showing the frequencies present in the audio signal, for this test there's a peak at ~ 30Hz, with various other peaks which reduce rapidly above 50Hz.

<img src="/static/2024-09-22-esp32-failed-audio-recorder/Frequency-Spectrum.png" alt="A frequency diagram showing a peak at approximately 30Hz, with various other speaks tapering off rapidly above 60Hz"  width="720" />

I interpret this as the accelerometer (and my recording script) having a decreasing sensitivity as the frequency increases, and almost no sensitivity above 60Hz.

Given human speech typically falls in the [range 90 - 255Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_frequency) this "recorder" won't be able to capture speech.

This is further confirmed by the fact the device [itself](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/motion-sensors/imus/bmi270/) supports a maximum accelerometer polling rate of 1.6kHz, this means the maximum audio frequency we [_could_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem) record would be 800Hz.

## Conclusions

The low sampling rate (~ 1kHz) and low sensitivity to typical speech frequencies mean this isn't a practical device to use as microphone. This still could have some uses, such as recording the frequency of dancers jumping at the club [Null Sector](https://wiki.emfcamp.org/2024/wiki/Null_Sector) to compare this to the tempo of the songs being played from worn Tildagons.
