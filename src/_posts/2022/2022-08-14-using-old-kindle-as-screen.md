# Using an old kindle e-reader as a screen

## First steps - find out the model
This can be found by checking the `model no` from the back. I had a gen 4, no touchscreen for example.

## Jailbreak it

## Install USB networking and set up link

and follow `README_FIRST.txt`

Actually running the commands on the kindle seems to be

Open keyboard
Type in command
Click `Done`
Press middle button again on the text bar


### macOS requires slightly different config
